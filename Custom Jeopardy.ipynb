First, I was thankful to have access to Alrbight's insights and experiences with world leaders; her unique pedigree and history offers perspective I could not dream of. Second, I was mildly alarmed that for this book—more than most others I have read—I knew I would forget the vast majority of information in the book. Keeping track of Orban, Erdogan, Chavez, and the names of cities, places, and other dictators is just too difficult for me to handle. I could, of course, have kept diligent notes while reading, but I figured that even then I might not be able to recall names and ideas when needed.\n\nLong story much shorter: I want to develop a simple Jeopardy game into which I can feed a keyword and then receive Jeopardy questions related to that keyword. Fortunately, the Jeopardy [Archive](http://www.j-archive.com) stores hundreds of thousands of past Jeopardy questions, which others have dutifully scraped from the JSON files in the archive.\n\nBecause my personal [website](http://www.jacobtbigham.com) is hosted on SquareSpace (don't @ me), databasing these questions was a little difficult, since I was forced to use Javascript (and I can't keep Promises, apparently) and could not use SQL. Fortunately, I learned a lot more from coding this project than I bargained for.\n\nHere's an example of gameplay:\n\n![Game](https://i.imgur.com/xm4DLKq.gif)\n\nA couple of features (and lack of features) worth noting:\n- Users input a single keyword or key phrase, to which the app then queries the database for matches.\n- Those keywords can match exactly or as substrings within other words (e.g., dog: dog, or erdogan).\n- I did not employ any ML algorithms to extract key words, phrases, or topics from questions and answers.\n- Instead, I give users the option to either view clues that *only* match the keyword **or** to get clues that matched the keyword *and* the other clues in the same categories as those clues. In this way, I let the Jeopardy writers do my ML for me.\n- If there are not enough clues that match a given keyword, then the keyword is rejected.\n- I used the Levenshtein distance between users' answers and correct answers to determine whether answers were correct.\n- I separated Final Jeopardy and regular Jeopardy questions so that users can get the full Jeopardy experience.\n- The first round contains one Daily Double question, and the second round contains two Daily Double questions.\n- Users can restart the game with a new keyword at any time.\n- Users can share their score to social media sites, along with the keyword for their custom game.\n- Users can alternatively opt to play a random Jeopardy game, with clues from random and unrelated categories.\n\nMy overall approach was the following:\n1. Construct a database to hold regular Jeopardy and Final Jeopardy questions\n2. Build a user interface with HTML and Javascript to interact with the database and present questions\n3. Enjoy!\n\nFeedback, suggestions, and corrections are greatly appreciated!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Wrangling"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First, let's load the data, which is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fxY181PdiA1KoJRG23ZVLC2Y5CIRqQWx), and take care of some of the easy wrangling.

The relative order of air dates is contained in the DataFrame index. Indeed, since database queries will access questions from top to bottom, **I'm going to reverse the vertical order of the entries**—with the caveat (CC) introduced below.\n\nSecond, I really don't care whether a clue was a Daily Double question, for two reasons: one, since I'm going to be pulling from questions across many categories anyways, it might be disruptive and unnecessarily costly to preserve this data; and two, and more importantly, the game has changed such that the location and relative difficulty of Daily Double questions seems random. So, **I'm going to drop the daily-double column**.\n\nThird, I don't so much care what round in which a question appeared. I do, however, care whether it was a Final Jeopardy question, since the syntax of those questions (and their difficulty) tends to differ from those of the normal rounds. I could add a separate column to track this—and remove the round column—but what **I'm going to instead do is create a separate DataFrame with just Final Jeopardy questions**. My rationale for this is speed: I'll only want to search for Final Jeopardy questions *when it's time for Final Jeopardy*, so there's no sense in keeping an unneeded extra column (round) or in keeping unneeded extra clues (the Final Jeopardy clues) in the same data structure as the normal clues. **I'll remove the round column after that separation**.\n\nFourth, there are some clues that originally had audio and video accompaniments that are not replicated here. Often these clues contain the phrase \"heard here\" or \"seen here.\" **I will remove clues that contain these phrases.**\n\nFinally, I also don't *really* care how much each question is worth; I only care about the relative order, which is contained in the index. So, **I'm going to drop the value column**. I do care, however, whether questions were in the same category group. Because category names are not unique, **I'm going to give each category from each game a distinct category_id**. (CC) Because I'll be flipping the vertical order of the clues, **I'll first flip the vertical order of the clues in each category**, such that after overall flipping, the harder (higher-valued) questions appear lower in the database.\n\nSo, let's go ahead and make these final changes:\n1. Remove the daily_double column\n2. Give each category a unique category_id\n3. Flip the vertical order of questions in each category\n4. Remove the value column\n5. Remove the air_date column\n6. Flip the overall vertical order of clues\n7. Remove and clues with \"heard here\" or \"seen here\" in the answer\n8. Separate regular and Final Jeopardy questions\n9.

To deal with some deviations in spellings—both in player input and database spelling—I've allowed a tolerance based on edit distance and answer length.
