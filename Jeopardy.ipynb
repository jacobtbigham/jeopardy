    "# Simple, Interactive, and Dynamic Jeopardy Web App\n",
    "I recently finished reading Madeleine Albright's engaging *Fascism: A Warning*, and upon completing it two thoughts crossed my mind. First, I was thankful to have access to Alrbight's insights and experiences with world leaders; her unique pedigree and history offers perspective I could not dream of. Second, I was mildly alarmed that for this book—more than most others I have read—I knew I would forget the vast majority of information in the book. Keeping track of Orban, Erdogan, Chavez, and the names of cities, places, and other dictators is just too difficult for me to handle. I could, of course, have kept diligent notes while reading, but I figured that even then I might not be able to recall names and ideas when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Long story much shorter: I want to develop a simple Jeopardy game into which I can feed a keyword and then receive Jeopardy questions related to that keyword. Fortunately, the Jeopardy [Archive](www.j-archive.com) stores hundreds of thousands of past Jeopardy questions, which others have dutifully scraped from the JSON files in the archive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because my personal [website](jacobtbigham.com) is hosted on SquareSpace (don't @ me), databasing these questions was a little difficult, since I was forced to use Javascript (and I can't keep Promises, apparently) and could not use SQL. Fortunately, I learned a lot more from coding this project than I bargained for.\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of features (and lack of features) worth noting:\n",
    "- Users input a single keyword or key phrase, to which the app then queries the database for matches.\n",
    "- Those keywords can match exactly or as substrings within other words (e.g., dog: dog, or erdogan).\n",
    "- I did not employ any ML algorithms to extract key words, phrases, or topics from questions and answers.\n",
    "- Instead, I give users the option to either view clues that *only* match the keyword **or** to get clues that matched the keyword *and* the other clues in the same categories as those clues. In this way, I let the Jeopardy writers do my ML for me.\n",
    "- If there are not enough clues that match a given keyword, then the keyword is rejected.\n",
    "- I used the Levenshtein distance between users' answers and correct answers to determine whether answers were correct.\n",
    "- I separated Final Jeopardy and regular Jeopardy questions so that users can get the full Jeopardy experience.\n",
    "- The first round contains one Daily Double question, and the second round contains two Daily Double questions.\n",
    "- Users can restart the game with a new keyword at any time.\n",
    "- Users can share their score to social media sites, along with the keyword for their custom game.\n",
    "- Users can alternatively opt to play a random Jeopardy game, with clues from random and unrelated categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "My overall approach was the following:\n",
    "1. Construct a database to hold regular Jeopardy and Final Jeopardy questions\n",
    "2. Build a user interface with HTML and Javascript to interact with the database and present questions\n",
    "3. Enjoy!\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback, suggestions, and corrections are greatly appreciated!"

    "Interesting problems were at fault here! For element 4257, which was a Final Jeopardy question, its category—EUROPE—was the same as the first category for the next show, so the code saw them all as one category. There's no need for an edit here, but I show the cells below to verify. The other two problematic values occurred for episodes that contained \"bonus\" rounds, where contestants could give either one or two of the two possible answers. I'll edit these manually since there are only two of these rounds:"

    "## App-Specific Wrangling\n",
    "Thinking ahead about implementation, I'd like to make a few little fixes. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, since I really don't care about the exact air date of each question, but I *do* care about the relative air dates (I'd like to prioritize newer questions), **I'm going to remove the air_date column**. The relative order of air dates is contained in the DataFrame index. Indeed, since database queries will access questions from top to bottom, **I'm going to reverse the vertical order of the entries**—with the caveat (CC) introduced below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, I really don't care whether a clue was a Daily Double question, for two reasons: one, since I'm going to be pulling from questions across many categories anyways, it might be disruptive and unnecessarily costly to preserve this data; and two, and more importantly, the game has changed such that the location and relative difficulty of Daily Double questions seems random. So, **I'm going to drop the daily-double column**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, I don't so much care what round in which a question appeared. I do, however, care whether it was a Final Jeopardy question, since the syntax of those questions (and their difficulty) tends to differ from those of the normal rounds. I could add a separate column to track this—and remove the round column—but what **I'm going to instead do is create a separate DataFrame with just Final Jeopardy questions**. My rationale for this is speed: I'll only want to search for Final Jeopardy questions *when it's time for Final Jeopardy*, so there's no sense in keeping an unneeded extra column (round) or in keeping unneeded extra clues (the Final Jeopardy clues) in the same data structure as the normal clues. **I'll remove the round column after that separation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth, there are some clues that originally had audio and video accompaniments that are not replicated here. Often these clues contain the phrase \"heard here\" or \"seen here.\" **I will remove clues that contain these phrases.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I also don't *really* care how much each question is worth; I only care about the relative order, which is contained in the index. So, **I'm going to drop the value column**. I do care, however, whether questions were in the same category group. Because category names are not unique, **I'm going to give each category from each game a distinct category_id**. (CC) Because I'll be flipping the vertical order of the clues, **I'll first flip the vertical order of the clues in each category**, such that after overall flipping, the harder (higher-valued) questions appear lower in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's go ahead and make these final changes:\n",
    "1. Remove the daily_double column\n",
    "2. Give each category a unique category_id\n",
    "3. Flip the vertical order of questions in each category\n",
    "4. Remove the value column\n",
    "5. Remove the air_date column\n",
    "6. Flip the overall vertical order of clues\n",
    "7. Remove and clues with \"heard here\" or \"seen here\" in the answer\n",
    "8. Separate regular and Final Jeopardy questions\n",
    "9. Remove the round column"

    "The fact that I have separate columns for category, answer, and question is not especially memory-intensive. Namely, I have to separatet the values *somehow*, and it's no costlier to store a comma than it is to store any other character. However, when I run database queries, it *is* costlier and requires unnecessarily more lines of code to run three queries (on category, answer, and question) and then merge the results than it is to just run one query for matches on the aggregate of those three values. So, I'm going to aggregate the data into just one block of text, where the category, question, and answer are separated by a `|` symbol."

    "First iterations of my implementation of the game allowed for the board to have fewer than 25 clues. For example, in the VENICE category in the above output, on the show in which that category was played, only three of the clues were revealed. I figured it would be better (and more inclusive) to give those categories a chance, but it just looks gross, especially when there are only 1 or 2 clues in a category. So, I'm going to assign any clues that belong to an incomplete category a category_id of 0, which I can then exclude from database searches when desired. Notably, this still allows clues from incomplete categories to appear in games in which the user does not opt to keep categories intact."
